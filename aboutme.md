Welcome to my personal page. My name is Joao Rebelo and I am an embedded software engineer. I am enthusiatic about technology in general and robotics and connected devices in particular. Lately I have become fascinated by the Rust programming language and its many possibilities so expect a lot of posts at least moderately related to that. I am also the co-founder of [S2E Systems](https://www.s2e-systems.com) where I have a chance of chanelling the things I like into my professional life.
