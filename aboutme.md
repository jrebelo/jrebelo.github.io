Welcome to my personal page. My name is Joao Rebelo and I am an embedded software engineer, generally enthusiatic about technology in general and robotics and connected devices in particular. Lately I have become fascinated by the Rust programming language and its many possibilities so expect a lot of posts at least moderately related to that.
